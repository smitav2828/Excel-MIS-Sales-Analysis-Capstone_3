# Excel MIS Task – Sales Performance Analysis

## Scenario

In this task, I acted as the MIS Lead working with data received from three different departments. The objective was to identify the top sales representative by total revenue and determine the region they belong to, as requested by the CEO.

## Data Used

* ProductID
* Qty

*Sheet 2 – Reps

* RepID
* RepName
* Region

*Sheet 3 – Products

* ProductID

## Work Performed

* Used XLOOKUP in the Transactions sheet to bring in Rep Name and Region from the Reps sheet
* Used XLOOKUP to fetch Unit Price from the Products sheet
* Calculated Total Revenue for each transaction using Quantity × Unit Price
* Prepared the dataset so total revenue can be summarized to identify the top-performing sales rep

## Excel Skills Used

* XLOOKUP across multiple sheets
* Data integration from different sources
* Revenue calculation
